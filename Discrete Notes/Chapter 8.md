### Multiplication Principle
 $$\newline$$

$
\textit{Ex: At Bona there are 6 soups on the menu, and 7 kinds of  
fried rice. In how many ways can I order a soup and  
fried rice?}$
$\text{6} \cdot \text{7}$

 $$\newline$$

$\textit{Ex: Let |A| = 5 and |B| = 6.}$
$\textit{How many functions from A to B are there?}$
$6^5$
$\textit{How many functions from B to A are there?}$
$5^6$
