## Multiplication Principle
 $$\newline$$

$\textit{Ex: At Bona there are 6 soups on the menu, and 7 kinds of  
fried rice. In how many ways can I order a soup and  
fried rice?}$
$\text{6} \cdot \text{7}$
$\newline$



$\textit{Ex: Let |A| = 5 and |B| = 6.}$
$\textit{How many functions from A to B are there?}$
$6^5$

$\textit{How many functions from B to A are there?}$
$5^6$


## Inclusion Exclusion
Two sets:
|A $\cup$ B| = |A| + |B| - |A $\cap$ B|

Three sets:
|A $\cup$ B $\cup$ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A $\cap$ B| - |A $\cap$ C| - |B $\cap$ C| + |A $\cap$ B $\cap$ C|

## Pigeonhole Principle

Suppose that a flock of 20 pigeons flies into a set of 19 pigeonholes to roost. Because there are 20 pigeons but only 19 pigeonholes, at least one of these 19 pigeonholes must have at least two pigeons in it.

## Permutations and Combinations

$P(n,k)$ =$\begin{pmatrix}   n\\   k   \end{pmatrix}$= $\huge{\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}}$ 
(use when order does matter)


$C(n,k)$ =$\begin{pmatrix}   c\\   k   \end{pmatrix}$ =  $\huge{\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}}$ 
(use when order does not matter)


$\begin{pmatrix}   n+k-1\\   n-1   \end{pmatrix}$  
(use when elements possibly repeat)


$n^k$ 
(use for k-length string over alphabet A={1,2,3...})


Add permutations to signify OR, multiply to signify AND
